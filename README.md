# Hidden Workforce #

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9f928f5a-9060-4968-b22c-3d2c0d54106e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sharp-bhaskara-334132/deploys)

A very simple starter page for Hidden Workforce (www.hiddenworkforce.com); a network of contract & freelance software developers, architects & testers.

It's open source and built using Gatsby ([it's based on the default Gatsby Starter template](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)), so can be extended in future.

If you're a member, feel free to suggest ideas for its growth on the group channels; anyone welcome to help build it into something useful!

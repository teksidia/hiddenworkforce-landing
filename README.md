# Hidden Workforce #

A very simple starter page for Hidden Workforce (www.hiddenworkforce.com); a network of contract & freelance software developers, architects & testers.

It's open source and built using Gatsby, so can be extended in future.

If you're a member, feel free to suggest ideas for its growth on the group channels; anyone welcome to help build it into something useful!
